# Subtitle CC remover

English subtitles are sometimes only available as the "CC" versions that include descriptions such as (LOUD EXPLOSION) to help hearing-impaired viewers.

However, many viewers prefer English subtitles with English audio (e.g. second-language speakers), but have no hearing issues. For them, CCs are unnecessary and distracting.

This little program removes lines that are fully inside brackets or parentheses (most common way to write CCs), and rebuilds the .srt file accordingly.
