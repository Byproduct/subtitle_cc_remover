English subtitles are sometimes only available as the "CC" versions that include 
descriptions such as (LOUD EXPLOSION) to help hearing-impaired viewers.

However, many viewers prefer English subtitles with English audio 
(e.g. second-language speakers), but have no hearing issues. 
For them, CCs are unnecessary and distracting.

This program removes lines that are fully inside brackets or parentheses 
(most common way to write CCs), and rebuilds the .srt file accordingly.

If you don't have python, a windows .exe is available [here](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZ4Um85ZLQwOK0SKEuBREQM27mlDypuGzuaX). 
It is this same source built using pyinstaller. 

This program is completely free to use with no strings attached. 
It does not collect any data or do any other sketchy things.
If you find it helpful, you could [help me out with a small donation](https://buymeacoffee.com/byproduct), but it is completely optional.
